It was clear that much more could have been done to build a stronger case. The investigative work felt rushed and incomplete, reflecting a lack of effort by both the police and the state. Unfortunately, I donâ€™t believe the individuals involved will receive any meaningful support after this. To the state, it seemed like just another case to move through the system.",
